# Unmanned-aircraft-LQR-and-LQG-design
LQG/LQR design for unmanned aircraft (course project)


Tune an LQR controller for the continuous-time system. and show that it can regulate small deviations from the equilibrium with reasonable control input magnitudes.

Derive a Kalman filter for the system, and obtain the system response using only output feedback (LQG)

Inject some process and output noise in the systems to test the Kalman filter.
